# TASKS.md — TODOs, Risks, and Recommended Work

## Dictionary suggestions + word_contributor achievement — June 2026

- [x] Raise app loading intro time to ≥10 s (was 6 s)
- [x] Restore `/dictionarySuggestions` Firebase path + rules (user append-only, admin read)
- [x] `submitWordSuggestion` — any signed-in user can suggest a word for admin review
- [x] `findPendingSuggestionsForWords` + `markSuggestionsApproved` — give credit when admin approves
- [x] `setUserSuggestVisible` in main.js — shows suggestion panel for any non-anonymous user
- [x] Settings section "💡 הצע מילה למילון" (`#user-suggest-panel`) with input + status
- [x] `wordsAccepted` stat added to `EMPTY_STATS` in `profileService.js`
- [x] `word_contributor` achievement (20 accepted suggestions → 250 coins, gold tier)
- [ ] **Hardening:** admin UI to list/review pending suggestions from `/dictionarySuggestions`
  (current admin flow still direct-add; suggestions are credited retroactively when a word matches)
- [ ] **Hardening:** prevent a user from spamming suggestions to farm the achievement —
  consider rate-limiting per-session or a daily cap on submissions

## Avatar store + coin economy — June 2026

- [x] Achievements decoupled from avatars → coin trophies: tapping no longer equips; coin prize shown per tile +
  hint + completion overlay; trophy-centric eval (`diffNewlyCompletedAchievements`); `data-ach-id` tiles
- [x] 3 purchase achievements (`first_buy`, `collector`, `legend_owner`) with `ownedCount`/`ownedInCategory`/
  `ownedCategories` conditions
- [x] Pure catalog `src/ui/screens/avatarStore.js` — 36 avatars across common/rare/epic/legendary + helpers
- [x] Profile economy fields (`coins`, `ownedAvatars`, `lastLoginDate`, `loginStreak`) + `bumpCoins`,
  `purchaseAvatar`, `computeDailyReward`/`claimDailyReward`, `normalizeProfileEconomy` in `profileService.js`
- [x] Earning: starter grant (sign-up), daily login + streak (boot), achievement-completion coins (diff loop)
- [x] Store UI: `#savatar-store` screen + `#ov-store-confirm` + `#ov-daily-reward`; entry from profile screen
- [x] Render-helper integration so equipped store avatars show everywhere (incl. opponent cards) — `avatarEmoji`
  pass-through + `avatarIconSrc` store-id resolution
- [x] Anonymous users gated to the account-upgrade prompt; PNGs excluded from sw.js precache
- [ ] **Hardening (not v1):** make purchases server-authoritative (Cloudflare Worker / Cloud Function) so coins
  can't be self-granted client-side
- [ ] **Hardening (not v1):** record `claimedAchievements[]` checked inside the transaction so achievement coin
  rewards are fully idempotent across devices/tabs
- [ ] Optional: surface a coin badge in the bottom nav (coins already flow through `MENU_REFRESH`)

## In-game UI bug fixes — June 2026

- [x] Pause/exit overlay no longer shows twice — `BACK_INTENT.PAUSE_AND_SAVE` performs save-and-exit directly instead of re-opening the identical `#ov-pause` overlay (`gameFlowController.js` shared `saveAndExit` helper)
- [x] "תור נוסף!" reward shows `images/icons/extra turn.png` instead of a tinted 🎯 glyph (`describeBoost` + `showBonusAwardOverlay` in `gameScreen.js`)

## Bonus/challenge popups — premium redesign — June 2026

- [x] Phase 1: shared premium chrome (CSS) for `#ov-bonus-intro`, `#ov-bonus`, `.bonus-award-card` — container, lightning header, gold title, cyan glowing progress bar, System-C buttons, huge gold reward numbers, hidden-word grid, 250ms entrance
- [x] Reusable premium primitives in `menu-electric.css` (`.bz-overlay`, `.bz-card`, `.bz-bolt`, `.bz-title`, `.bz-sub`, `.bz-btn`/`-gold`/`-blue`/`-green`, `.bz-burst`) — adopt these in each game instead of inline cssText
- [x] Phase 3 (shared FX): `src/ui/screens/miniGames/bonusFx.js` — `confettiBurst`, `countUp`, `showBonusResult` (premium success/failure screens); CSS for confetti, `.bz-result*`, `.bz-chip`, premium `.ut`/`.lsbox`/`.ri`. 9 tests in `tests/unit/bonus-fx.test.js`
- [x] Phase 2: per-game premium passes (all complete — each keeps its mount contract + `*.test.js` green):
  - [x] Lucky Wheel (`wheelMiniGame.js`) — glossy wheel + gold rim, bigger slot icons, glowing pointer, premium hub, gold spin button, reward-explosion bloom
  - [x] Word Bee / honeycomb (`honeycombMiniGame.js`) — gold center + ceramic outer tiles, reward chips, celebration/encouragement end states
  - [x] Hidden Word (`hiddenWordMiniGame.js`) — premium self-host, gold button, `showBonusResult` (grid already premium)
  - [x] Personal Boost / crossword (`crosswordMiniGame.js`) — premium card + result header, confetti on clean win, friendly fail
  - [x] Crossing Words (`crossingWordsMiniGame.js`) — premium self-host, green check, `.bz-result` win/soft screens
  - [x] Fill-Middle (`fillMiddleMiniGame.js`) — ceramic `.ut` tiles, green check, `.bz-result` + confetti
  - [x] Unscramble (`unscrambleMiniGame.js`) — premium card, cyan timer bar, ceramic tiles, `.bz-result` win + confetti
  - [x] Letter Spinner (`letterSpinnerMiniGame.js`) — premium `.lsbox`, gold buttons, reward chips, `showBonusResult`
- [ ] Future polish: per-game combo indicators, live word-validation flourishes, and richer hint-reveal animations (functional gaps, not blockers)

## Invite-contacts referral flow — June 2026

- [x] `src/ui/inviteFriends.js` — Contacts Picker → SMS, with share-sheet / clipboard fallback (`runInviteFlow`)
- [x] "חבר מביא חבר" achievement re-keyed `friendsCount min:10` → `invitesSent min:5` (avatar + achievement)
- [x] `invitesSent` stat added to `EMPTY_STATS`; bumped on successful invite
- [x] Friends-screen referral card made clickable (`INVITE_CONTACTS`); progress bar tracks invites, shows `/5`
- [x] `#fr-invite-status` flash messages; `.fr-invite-status` CSS
- [x] 14 unit tests in `tests/unit/invite-friends.test.js`
- [ ] Replace `PLAY_STORE_URL` placeholder package id with the real listing URL at publish
- [ ] Fallback paths (share/clipboard) grant the achievement on a single completed action since recipients can't be counted — revisit if abuse becomes a concern

## Loading-screen Tips system — June 2026

- [x] `data/tips.json` — 23 tips across beginner / intermediate / advanced / didYouKnow
- [x] `src/ui/loadingTipsService.js` — weighted selection, history, games-played cache
- [x] `index.html` — tip card HTML (icon, title, text, nav arrows, dots) in `#app-loading`
- [x] `src/main.js` — carousel wired in `wireAppLoading()`; `cacheGamesPlayed` on profile load
- [x] `styles.css` — `.app-loading-tips` / `.app-loading-tip-*` glass-card design
- [x] 17 unit tests in `src/ui/loadingTipsService.test.js`
- [ ] Future: admin/dev tip management screen (`ניהול טיפים`) — view/enable/disable/edit tips without code changes
- [ ] Future: migrate `tips.json` to Firestore `/tips` collection for remote management

## Secondary Screens — premium Boost redesign — June 2026

- [x] My Games: System C back button (30 px, less dominant)
- [x] My Games: Poke button (👋) restyled as 44 px circular badge
- [x] My Games: Score pill visual weight reduced; name bumped to 15 px

- [x] Coin Toss: Gold gradient text for `.coin-msg`; premium disabled state for CTA
- [x] Notifications: `nf-shell` scrollable container replacing `.sbox`
- [x] Notifications: `nf-header` with bell icon + gradient divider
- [x] Notifications: Premium empty-state card with bell icon + "אתם מעודכנים ✔"

## Settings Screen — premium 4-section redesign — June 2026

- [x] Replace `.set-panel` grid with scrollable `.sett-section` column layout
- [x] Sticky `.sett-header` with icon + title + close × button

- [x] Section 3 (🧠 כלי עזר): word checker as premium tool block
- [x] Section 4 (📚 ניהול מילון, admin-only, hidden): green add card + red remove card
- [x] Blue active state for `.set-yn.active-yes` (override of default gold `var(--by)`)
- [x] Footer CTA `.sett-confirm-btn` with enhanced glow
- [x] All IDs and onclick attributes preserved; `settingsScreen.js` wiring unchanged

## Victory Screen — premium celebration redesign — June 2026

- [x] Replace circular floating-platform buttons with three stacked System C action cards
- [x] Card layout: PNG icon (left) + title/subtitle (center, RTL) + glowing circular chevron (right)
- [x] Color variants: online = cyan, bot = blue, 2p = purple

## Match Flow System — premium redesign — June 2026

- [x] `mf-*` CSS system in `menu-electric.css`: hero icon, opt-cards (.active + .a), mf-cta, mf-cancel, mf-code-input, animated dots
- [x] Online Lobby: floating animated globe, ol-hero header, larger omode-btn icon badges
- [x] Create Room overlay: hero icon, card-based mode + speed selectors, green CTA
- [x] Join Code overlay: hero icon, large monospace code input, clear hierarchy
- [x] Matchmaking overlay: hero icon, card-based mode + speed + rating selectors, animated search dots
- [x] Partner Search overlay: pulsing dice icon, animated dots, glass player cards, my-card heartbeat glow
- [x] Setup screen: difficulty + speed + racks all converted to mf-opt-card; mf-setup-header title area

## Friend detail popup — premium visual redesign — June 2026

- [x] Avatar hero with 110 px glow ring + crown on top; name as large centered heading
- [x] 3-column stat widget (🎮 משחקים / 🏆 ניצחונות / 🛡 הפסדים) replacing plain text; win-rate removed
- [x] Recent games: colored win/loss indicator circle + ltr score display + time-ago string
- [x] Active games empty state: icon + friend's name in message; no conditional invite button
- [x] Permanent green CTA "✉ הזמן למשחק" at bottom of overlay
- [x] Overflow menu (⋮) with הסר חבר + future slots; removed large red remove button
- [x] Wider popup: min(360px, 94vw)

## UI modernization: secondary screens — June 2026

- [x] Replace 👤 emoji with `anonymous player.png` everywhere (centralized in `avatarMarkup`/`setAvatarEl`; menuScreen sign-out; index.html initial HTML)
- [x] Bot player avatar → `bot.png` via special `'bot'` avatar ID; matchmaking slot reel → achievement PNG icons via avatar IDs
- [x] Sliced 8 new icons from `more_navigation_buttons.png` (trophy, dice, key, logout, rematch, pause, play, search)
- [x] CSS: `.glass-panel`, `.ui-icon`, `.screen-hd-icon`, `.section-title-bar` utility classes; upgraded `.sbox`, `.stat-card`, `.fun-card`, `.fsc-c`, `.omode-btn`, `.set-panel`, `.set-yn`
- [x] Settings screen: PNG icons (settings, sound_on/off, bell, search), glass-panel sections
- [x] Statistics screen: statistics.png header, sopt-btn tabs, glass-panel hero, section-title-bar labels
- [x] Profile screen: title cleanup, glass-panel stats grid, PNG button icons, profileScreen.js onboarding icon
- [x] End game: trophy.png + rematch.png + home.png icons
- [x] Pause overlay: pause.png header, play.png resume button (gender-safe span wrapper)
- [x] Online lobby: home.png / key.png / dice.png in .omode-ic spans
- [x] Async games: my_games.png empty-state icon
- [x] Setup screen: remove 👤 text from rack toggle

## Redesign: Achievements screen → trophy room — June 2026

- [x] Rebuilt `#sav-gallery` as a collectible trophy room: gold title + side lines, scrollable shelves of 3 (glossy plank + cyan underglow), big icon + title + gold/gray progress pill. Removed cards/progress-bars/tier-chips/starter selector.
- [x] Locked = real icon desaturated/darkened + padlock (not hidden); unlock pop/glow/lock-break animation; tap-to-equip preserved.
- [x] 10 achievement icons mapped from `images/icons/acheivements/`; rest fall back to emoji until added (`ACH_ICON_BY_AVATAR_ID`).
- [x] Dropped crown/star fillers (room shows the 17 achievements; header `<n> מתוך 17`).
- [x] All 17 icons now match their Hebrew title → icon path derived from `ach.titleHe` (no explicit map). `שחקן מנוסה` added; filename typos fixed. sw.js precache updated.
- [x] Locked overlay uses the gold padlock `images/icons/lock.png` instead of the 🔒 emoji.
- [x] Icons normalized to one size (object-fit box) and bottom-aligned + plank overlap so they sit on the shelves.
- [x] Equipped avatar now displays the achievement trophy icon (topbar + profile) via `avatarIconSrc`, replacing the legacy emoji.
- [x] Extended to the rest of the app via shared `avatarMarkup`/`setAvatarEl` + `.av-img`: in-game player/opponent strip, friends list+detail, notification cards+banner, incoming-invite, matchmaking my/matched avatar, stats hero+rivals. Removed duplicated per-screen avatar→emoji tables. (Decorative slot-reel stays emoji; My-Games has no avatars.)

## UI: setup + online-lobby mode icons use the new PNGs — June 2026

- [x] Pre-game setup header icons (`#stitle-icon-vs` → 1v1.png, `#stitle-icon-bot` → bot.png) replace the old inline SVGs; span IDs kept so `setupScreen.js` toggling is unchanged.
- [x] Online lobby title globe: `<canvas id="ol-globe">` → `<img>` globe.png; removed the last `globeRenderer.startGlobe` use and **deleted `src/ui/globeRenderer.js`** (now unused).

## Fix: bottom nav overlapping mode circles on wide/short screens — June 2026

- [x] On aspect ≥ ~0.56 the circles are height-limited (23svh) and the cluster overflowed under the bottom nav (tablets + wide-short phones like 412×690/732). Fixed via `@media (min-aspect-ratio: 13/25)`: trim the logo + tighten gaps + center the cluster. Circles NOT shrunk. Tall phones (≤0.51) untouched. Verified positive nav clearance across a viewport matrix.

## UI: equal/level/tight game-mode cluster — June 2026

- [x] All three mode circles equal size (unified `--circle-mode`); online centered on top (removed left shift); bottom two on the same level (removed per-column offsets + `align-items: flex-start`); horizontal + vertical gaps tightened.
- [x] Icons enlarged to nearly fill each circle (container `0.58×`, `.home-circle-img` scale `1.62`; online globe `1.45` so its pedestal clears the title). Titles stay fully visible in the bottom band.

## UI: top-bar nav icons from navigation_buttons.png — June 2026

- [x] Sliced the `navigation_buttons.png` sheet into the six top-bar icons (home/help/settings/sound_on/sound_off/bell), overwriting the existing filenames so no markup change was needed. (Updated sheet was non-transparent 4+3 layout → circular alpha mask extraction; plain bell used over the red-dot variant.)
- [x] Simplified `.em-icon-btn--home-active` to a circular cyan glow (the new icons are their own round buttons, so the old square gradient background was redundant).
- [x] Scaled top-bar buttons ~1.4× (`--topbar-btn` + matching `--em-topbar-h` term).
- [x] Scaled bottom-nav icons 2× (`.em-nav-icon-img` × 1.15 → × 2.3); labels/padding left at base so icons dominate over text.

## UI: home-screen v1.1 polish (icon presence + cluster) — June 2026

- [x] Top-nav action icons enlarged ~17% (`.em-icon-img` 82%→96%), capsule height/spacing unchanged.
- [x] Bottom-nav icons enlarged 15% (`.em-nav-icon-img` × 1.15), labels/alignment unchanged.
- [x] Removed the three game-mode subtitles; titles only. Cluster pulled up toward the logo (`.em-platforms` flex-start), lower pair pulled toward centre (reduced row gap + 2P offset), and spread vertically into the freed space for breathing room.

## UI: main-screen icon swap to new PNG set — June 2026

- [x] Replaced home-screen + global-topbar emoji/SVG/canvas icons with the new 3D PNGs in `images/icons/` (bell, sound_on/off, settings, help, home, globe, 1v1, bot, my_games, friends, acheivments, statistics). See CHANGELOG.
- [x] Precached the 13 used `images/icons/*.png` in the `sw.js` `ASSETS` list so the home screen renders offline from install (rather than only after first runtime fetch). Cache-name bump left to `stamp-build` at deploy.
- [x] Toned down `.em-icon-btn` (`menu-electric.css`): the top-bar button is now a transparent tap target at rest (faint disk on hover only) so it no longer competes with the icons' own pedestal/glow. The `.em-icon-btn--home-active` "current page" indicator keeps its filled glow.

## UI: turn glow + My-Games turn colour + bell badge fix — June 2026

- [x] Active-player glow thickened (1px → 3px brighter border + stronger `playerGlowPulse`) for `.scbox.act` and `.is-pcard.act-cell` so whose-turn is obvious.
- [x] Bottom-nav 🎮 "המשחקים שלי" badge turns green (`.em-nav-badge--myturn`) when it's the player's turn in an active online game; red otherwise. New `myTurnInGame` field on `MENU_REFRESH`.
- [x] Notifications bell (`#online-badge`) no longer lights from the my-turn signal — it conflated `hasOnlineUnread` (your turn in a game, no inbox entry) with real inbox items, so the bell flashed over an empty window. Bell now reflects only `unreadCount` (invites + friend requests).

## Fix: bot passing repeatedly — alphabetical vocab bias — June 2026

- [x] Easy (and to a lesser extent medium) bot passed turn after turn. The bot vocab cap in `main.js` took a raw prefix of the now alphabetically sorted `dictionary.txt`, so the pool was ~all `א`-words; with no `א` available the bot had no legal move. Compounded by the cap being applied before `searchBotMove`'s `maxWordLen` filter (easy → only 87 usable ≤3-letter words).
- [x] Fix: pre-filter to `resolveProfile(difficulty).maxWordLen` before capping, and `shuffle` (seeded via `util/rng.js`) before `slice`. Hard cap is now `Infinity`. Easy usable vocab: 87 (all `א`) → 2,000 across 25 initial letters.

## Dictionary: plain text + remove DAWG + remove HSpell pipeline — June 2026

- [x] Switched dictionary from DAWG binary (`dictionary.v2.bin`) to plain sorted text (`dictionary.txt`, 73,173 words).
- [x] Deleted `src/game/core/dawg.js` and `src/game/core/dawg.test.js`.
- [x] Deleted `data/dictionary.v2.bin` and `data/dictionary.v2.meta.json`.
- [x] Deleted `tools/dictionary-build/` (HSpell AGPLv3 pipeline — no longer needed).
- [x] `hebrewDictionary.js` is now a pure text-based `Set` lookup; no DAWG code remains.
- [x] `absorb-firebase-dict.mjs` updated to merge words into `dictionary.txt`.
- [ ] Run `node scripts/absorb-firebase-dict.mjs --commit` locally to absorb any existing Firebase-approved words into `dictionary.txt` and clear the Firebase overlay.

## Dictionary: v1 removal + Firebase absorption script — June 2026

- [x] Removed v1 dictionary path (`loadDict`, v1 `isValid`, mode switching). `hebrewDictionary.js` is now v2-only.
- [x] Deleted `data/dictionary.base.txt`, `scripts/add-dictionary-words.js`, `scripts/export-dictionary-file.js`.
- [x] Bot now uses `DICT` instead of legacy frequency-sorted vocabulary.

## Dictionary additions from curated review list — June 2026

- [x] Added words from `words_sorted_for_review.txt`: 10,624 to `dictionary.base.txt` (40K→50K), 10,012 genuinely new words to `dictionary.v2.bin` (63K→73K). DAWG binary rebuilt and self-tested. Report at `added-words.txt`.

## Fix: forfeiting player not notified of game end — June 2026

- [x] `forceResync()` in `onlineGameSession.js` now emits `EV.GAME_COMPLETED` when the resynced room is in a terminal state (abandoned/completed/expired) and the session hadn't already transitioned. Closes the race where the opponent's watchdog-forfeit write races the forfeiting player's last-moment commit.

## Dictionary reject/accept lists → Firebase only — June 2026

- [x] Removed in-code `EXACT_REJECTS` / `CLASSIC_ALLOW` / `DEFECTIVE_ACCEPT` from `hebrewDictionary.js`; reject/accept now via Firebase overlays only (`BLOCKED_OVERLAY` / approved-overlay). Kept `COMMON_FALSE_POSSESSIVE` (morphology). Tests + docs updated.
- [ ] **Load `docs-md/dictionary-firebase-seed.txt` into Firebase** — REJECTED block → `/dictionaryRejected`, APPROVED block → `/dictionaryApproved`. Until then `נאצי` / `ירושלים` and the inflected prepositions are not blocked by the app. (Use the dictionary admin panel or Firebase console import.)
- [ ] (optional) Decide whether `tools/dictionary-build/*` should also stop applying its own `EXACT_REJECTS`/`CLASSIC_ALLOW` when the DAWG is next rebuilt.

## Fix: easy-bot default + Bubblewrap removal — June 2026

- [x] Easy bot played 5-letter words: the bot difficulty default was medium (1) while setup.html highlighted easy. Defaulted difficulty to 0 (easy) in `setupScreen.js` + `main.js` `START_VS_BOT`. Profiles unchanged (already correct).
- [x] Removed Bubblewrap: deleted root TWA/Gradle working copy + `twa-manifest.json`; build via the `android/` Android Studio project. Updated `firebase.json`, `FILE_INDEX.md`.
- [ ] (pre-existing, unrelated) 2 `setupScreen.test.js` title-text assertions + 2 `gameEngine.test.js` rack fixtures fail on HEAD; not in the `test:unit` gate. Fix when next touching those areas.

## Fix: timer_bonus (+10s wheel) — June 2026

- [x] Offline/optional modes: B13 `timer_bonus` now actually extends the turn clock. Engine records `state.turnTimerBonusMs` in `applyTurnStartEffects`; `turnTimerController.ensureDeadline` adds + consumes it. Plugin accumulates the delta. Tests in `turnTimerController.test.js` + `plugins.test.js`.
- [x] Online: `onlineGameSession.rawCommitCurrentState` adds `state.turnTimerBonusMs` to the next player's deadline (read once before the txn callback, cleared after the commit resolves → idempotent across retries). Test in `onlineGameSession.test.js` (mockFirebase). No rule change (no upper bound on `turnDeadlineMs`).

## B11 retune + new B14 mini-game — June 2026

- [x] B11 מילה נסתרת: timer 20s→10s, reward 100→30 (defs, data, gender/desc, guide, capture spec, tests).
- [x] New B14 **אות פותחת** (letter spinner): spin alphabet → stop on a letter → make words starting with it in 20s, scored by length like כוורת (reuses `wordPoints`). New `letterSpinnerMiniGame.js` + 9 tests; wired into `BONUS_TYPES`/defs/main.js/intro/gender; CSS `.lsbox`; guide figure + `letterspinner.png`.
- [ ] (pre-existing, unrelated) `src/game/core/gameEngine.test.js` has 2 failing CONFIRM_MOVE rack/dictionary fixture tests (`placed-not-in-rack`) — not in the `test:unit` gate; fix the rack setup when touching that area.

## B11 bonus redesign — June 2026

- [x] Replace תפזורת (word search) with **מילה נסתרת** (hidden word): 4×4 grid, one hidden 3-letter dictionary word, 20s timer; selections validated against the dictionary (not the hidden word) so any real word wins. New `hiddenWordMiniGame.js` + tests; removed `wordSearchMiniGame.js`; rewired B11 (`b11_hidden_word`), intro/gender copy, CSS, docs.
- [x] Regenerate the guide screenshot `images/guide/minigames/hiddenword.png` (e2e `hiddenword` shot); guide figure now points at it. Also fixed `showBonusOverlay` to hide the `#app-loading` splash that was clipping mini-game captures. Old `wordsearch.png` is now unreferenced (can be deleted).

## Bot difficulty distinguishability — June 2026

- [x] Make easy/medium/hard clearly distinct — `DIFFICULTY_PROFILES` + `pickMove` in `botSearch.js`; easy is now beginner-level (short words, low picks, weak opener, score ceiling, blunder chance). `main.js` vocab cap 5000→2000 for easy + per-level think time. Calibrated easy≈8 / med≈30 / hard≈34. Tunable constants flagged in GAP_REPORT.

## QA bug-fix batch — June 2026 (`Some-bugs-found` branch)

- [x] Async friend invite shows a toast instead of the waiting-room hourglass (`main.js` `CR_INTENT.CONFIRM`).
- [x] Settings overlay top-corner "×" close button (`#sett-close-x`).
- [x] Friend-detail avatar resolves id → emoji (no literal "crown") (`friendsScreen.js`) + test.
- [x] Cold-start push routing: `?resume=`/`?summary=`/`?open=` handled at boot (`main.js` `handleLaunchParams`).
- [x] "סיום" ends an async game (resign) — `gameFlowController.js`; home button stays leave-and-resume.
- [x] Coin toss only at game start — `startOnlineGameViaSpine` skips it once a room has moves.
- [x] My-Games screen live-updates on an opponent move — `main.js` watches each listed async room (`watchRoom`) while `#smygames` is open, tears down on navigate-away. Previously the card only refreshed on (re)open because the async index doesn't change on a move.
- [x] Game-over push is informative — names the winner from each player's perspective + final score (`notificationService` + `pushPayloadBuilder`, client + worker). Needs `cd worker && npm run deploy`.
- [x] Matchmaking 3-player race no longer double-books a partner — `tryPair` single-driver (lower uid) claims both queue nodes. See `DECISIONS.md` D-matchmaking-claim. ⚠️ Re-run the simulator matchmaking scenario (`npm run sim -- --scenario matchmaking`) against the emulator before relying on it under heavy concurrency.
- [x] "×2 boost triples score": **could not reproduce** — engine verified ×2/×4 correct, regression tests added (`gameEngine.test.js`). Confirmed by reporter as not an issue.
- [x] "Skipping a תפזורת still grants bonus points": **verified correct, no bug** — a 0-find skip commits only the base word score (resolveBonusActivation/resolveMiniGameResult/FINALIZE all award 0). Reporter confirmed the score came from the placed word, not the bonus. Regression test added (`engine-parity-highrisk.test.js`: "skipping an interactive mini-game … commits only the base word score").

---

## TODOs — Dictionary v2 rollout

The runtime swap + build-pipeline scaffolding landed in June 2026 (see CHANGELOG). What's left before flipping the default and removing the v1 path:

- [ ] **Run the build pipeline end-to-end.** Needs WSL/Linux for HSpell (perl + autotools). Steps: `bash 01-fetch-hspell.sh` → `node 02-enumerate.js` → `03a-extract-lemmas.js` → `03b-corroborate-lemmas.js` → `03c-filter-lemmas.js` → `03d-inflect.js`. Produces `output/lemmas-review.tsv` for the next step.
- [ ] **Acquire corroboration sources.** Hebrew Wiktionary lemma dump and Hebrew Wikipedia frequency list. Currently the pipeline runs without them (single-source HSpell) — every lemma falls to the review queue. With Wiktionary alone, expect ~70% of lemmas to auto-accept.
- [ ] **Native-speaker review of `pending-review.csv`.** Budget: 20–40 hours for the initial pass. Decisions go into `tools/dictionary-build/review/manual-decisions.tsv` and persist across rebuilds.
- [ ] **Seed `tools/dictionary-build/config/gold-positive.txt` from real player-rejection logs.** Every "this word should have been valid" complaint becomes a held-out test the build can't regress.
- [ ] **Legal sign-off on HSpell GPLv2.** See [tools/dictionary-build/LICENSE.md](../tools/dictionary-build/LICENSE.md) — if the project can't accept GPLv2 implications, switch to Hunspell `he_IL` or commission a permissive list.
- [ ] **Canary the `?dict=v2` flag.** Open the app with `?dict=v2` and exercise the formerly-rejected-real-words list. Watch the console for `[isValidV2]` logs.
- [ ] **Flip default.** Change `dictionaryModeFromUrl()` in `main.js` to default `'v2'`. Keep `?dict=v1` as a rollback switch for one release.
- [ ] **Cleanup commit (separate PR):** delete `data/dictionary.base.txt`, the v1 morphology chain in `hebrewDictionary.js` (`candidateLemmas`, `spellingVariants`, `POSSESSIVE_SUFFIXES`, `VERB_SUFFIXES`, `looksLikePrefixedParticle`, `looksLikePossessive`, `analyze`'s lemma branch), the v1 loader, and the mode switch. Update tests accordingly.

## TODOs — Online Simulator (Phase 5)

- [ ] Deferred-score split-write scenario: dispose the active session AFTER `MOVE_CONFIRMED(scoringDeferred=true)` but BEFORE `FINALIZE_BOOST_AWARD`. Verify the room state stays consistent (no half-committed move), the opponent's view isn't corrupted, and the reconnected session correctly sees the move as never-committed. Needs bonus-square placement to be driven deterministically (bonuses sit at off-grid edges; random bot rarely hits them) — either inject a scripted-move bot or seed the engine state with `state.pendingScoreCommit` directly.
- [ ] Admin-SDK exporter that pulls `moveHistory` arrays from prod rooms into the JSON shape `replayBot` expects, for `--replay` mode (needs prod creds).
- [ ] Presence/heartbeat stress: multiple concurrent `presenceService` writes from the same uid (multi-tab), verify `onDisconnect` cleanup doesn't fight presence heartbeat.

---

## Completed (June 2026)

- ✅ **ROOT CAUSE** of push not working: service worker never registered. `sw.js` precached with atomic `cache.addAll()` while the `ASSETS` list still referenced 3 deleted admin partials → every `install` 404'd → `SW registrations: 0` → no push token, no offline cache. Removed dead entries and switched to per-asset `cache.add().catch()` so a stale list entry degrades gracefully instead of killing the whole SW. Also added independent `sw.js` registration in `main.js` (app previously relied on OneSignal.init to register it).
- ⚠️ Follow-up: `sw.js` `ASSETS` list is hand-maintained and drifts when partials are added/removed; `scripts/stamp-build.js` only stamps the cache name. Consider generating the precache list from `screenPartialManifest.js` + a glob so it can't go stale again.
- ✅ Removed the temporary 🩺 "אבחון התראות" diagnostic panel (settings.html + `diagnoseNotifications` in main.js + `getLastBootError` in notificationService.js) now that push works end-to-end. Kept `isOneSignalReady()` — the duplicate-notification fix depends on it.
- ✅ Invite notifications now distinguish live (⚡ "למשחק עכשיו") vs async (📩 "למשחק תורות") via an `isLive` ctx flag through both payload-builder copies.
- ✅ Notification "הפעל" button no longer gets stuck on its spinner — `requestNotifPermission()` (`src/main.js`) now pre-checks push support (shows "לא נתמך בדפדפן זה" in unsupported/in-app webviews), wraps `boot()`/`optIn()` in timeouts, and always re-syncs the button state in a `finally`, so a hung OneSignal SDK leaves the control retryable instead of permanently disabled.
- ✅ Live-invite waiting room now closes on rejection (friend auto-invite path) — fixed an ordering bug in `CR_INTENT.CONFIRM` (`src/main.js`) where `activePending.inviteId` was assigned before `activePending` existed, so the invite-ack listener couldn't match a rejection to the open waiting room. Now captured into locals and folded into `activePending` at construction; also repairs WR-cancel invite revocation for the same path.
- ✅ Welcoming home-screen onboarding popup — the first-visit popup on `#sh` now opens with a short intro on what Boost is, four feature bullets (שבץ-נא, בוסטים/mini-games, statistics & insights, game modes), and a closing note pointing to the `?` button for full rules. Added optional `intro` / `note` fields to the onboarding content model (rendered by `onboardingController.js` into new `#onb-intro` / `#onb-note` elements; both `hidden` when omitted, so other screens are unaffected). See `partials/screens/onboarding-overlay.html`, `src/ui/controllers/onboardingController.js`, `src/ui/screens/menuScreen.js`, `styles.css`.
- ✅ Bot boost visibility — the human player now sees a modal overlay when the bot receives an auto-boost (B2/B4/B9) or a future-effect boost (B5/B6/B7), matching the 2P offline experience. Overlay is labelled "הבוט". Clicking אישור finalises the award. Mini-game and wheel bot bonuses (B1/B3/B8/B10/B11/B12/B13) are still auto-resolved silently — that's a separate follow-up.

- ✅ Stats "תובנות" tab — turned the stats area into a personalised analytics experience (archetype, dynamic insight cards, trend chips, week snapshot, word intelligence, play-style bars, opponent picks, milestones, did-you-know). Tabs reordered to `תובנות | התקדמות | שיאים | יריבים`. All derivation in pure module `src/game/account/playerInsights.js` with 23 unit tests; no schema changes. See CHANGELOG entry for "Stats screen: new תובנות tab" for the full breakdown of what's derived vs deferred (rating history, dated words, monthly windows still need new tracking infra).
- ✅ "המשחקים שלי" v3 — visual redesign: cards instead of a list (rounded 18px, navy gradient + soft shadow), score-dominant typography (gold mine + white theirs in a glowing pill), emoji-prefixed status pills (🟢/🕒/💾/🔵), compact gold-gradient Continue button, 🗑 dismiss icon (replaces the floating ×), header back-arrow + count badge (replaces the big footer button). All scoped to `#smygames` CSS; no functionality changes. Screenshot at `images/guide/my-games-screen.png`, capture spec at `tests/e2e/capture-my-games-screen.spec.js`.
- ✅ "המשחקים שלי" v2 — removed the floating "המשך משחק" home-screen play button; folded the localStorage-saved offline game into the same list (rendered with a 💾 badge + "משחק שמור" label, sentinel `roomId: '__local__'`, MG_INTENT.RESUME/DISMISS branch on the sentinel to call `resumeLocalGameViaSpine` / `clearLocalGame`); widened the modal to `min(460px, 94vw)`. See `partials/screens/home.html`, `partials/screens/async-games-screen.html`, `src/main.js refreshMyGamesList`, `src/ui/screens/asyncGamesScreen.js`.
- ✅ New "המשחקים שלי" screen — standalone list of all of the user's async online games, reachable from the home screen's bottom nav. Each row shows opponent avatar + name, current score, whose turn + time since last move, "המשך" to resume, "×" to remove from the per-user index. Expired games are surfaced too (sorted to the end) so users can see + clear them. Extended `asyncSessionService.listAsyncSessions(db, uid, { includeExpired })` and added `myScore` / `opponentScore` / `isExpired` to the summary shape. See `partials/screens/async-games-screen.html`, `src/ui/screens/asyncGamesScreen.js`, `src/main.js`.
- ✅ Async push bug fix — `TURN_CHANGED` push was fired from the recipient's side (`externalIds: [s.myUid]` when `currentTurnSlot === mySlot`), so async opponents who weren't online when the move synced never got notified. Flipped the async path to sender-side: when our move leaves our slot, push the opponent (`externalIds: [opponentUid]`, optional `subscriptionIds: [opponentSubscriptionId]`) with the body labelled by `myName`. Live mode (`ifBackgrounded`) keeps the existing receiver-side self-push. Sessions now expose `myName` via `sessionRef`. See `notificationService.js`, `main.js`.
- ✅ UI bug fix — clicking a pending lock now reliably returns it to the bucket. Previously, the single-click toggle inside `setPendingLock` cleared the lock, but a fast double-tap fell through to the auto-quick-place branch and re-placed the lock at the same cell, so the user saw no change. Added an explicit early-return for pending-lock cells in `onCellClick` + a short (500 ms) per-cell suppression window for the quick-place branch. See `gameScreen.js`.
- ✅ Engine bug fix — `handleConfirmMove` rack-defense incorrectly rejected `placed-not-in-rack` when a player reused a swap-displaced board letter in the same move. The UI was already designed to surface the displaced letter at the swap's rack slot for same-turn play (legacy `racks[turn][rackSlot] = returnedLetter` parity), so the engine was out of sync. Split the single-pass rack check into a swap-first pass that credits the rack copy with each swap-displaced letter, then validates `placed` against that effective rack. New regression test in [tests/unit/engine-placed-not-in-rack.test.js](../tests/unit/engine-placed-not-in-rack.test.js).
- ✅ Boost mini-game screenshots in the guide — six new PNGs under `images/guide/minigames/` captured by a new Playwright spec ([tests/e2e/capture-minigame-screenshots.spec.js](../tests/e2e/capture-minigame-screenshots.spec.js)) that mounts each mini-game with a seeded RNG and snaps the overlay. Each image embedded under "בונוסים ומיני-משחקים" with a matching caption. Side fix: exposed the previously-internal `mountFillMiddleMiniGame` on `window.__spine.ui`.
- ✅ Cherry-pick from `online-game-fixes` — surgical port of additive fixes that never reached `main`: guide-screen screenshots + the new "פעולות מיוחדות בתור" section, signup password-confirm + notify opt-in + 👁 show/hide on login+signup, friends `activeRoom` permission fix, easy-bot vocabulary cap (first 7000 dict entries), dict CLOSE_QUERY event, `btn-shailta` id, friends recent-games LTR layout. Explicitly skipped the rollback half of that commit (would have wiped portrait lock, rotate-block, connectivity indicator, gender propagation, back-button handler). The ם/מ sofit fix the user remembered turned out to already be on the current branch via PRs #276/277/278 + `f64be250`. See `docs-md/CHANGELOG.md` for the full file-level breakdown.
- ✅ Portrait-orientation enforcement — installed PWA already locked via `manifest.json`. For in-browser use, added `screen.orientation.lock('portrait')` in [src/main.js](../src/main.js) (works in fullscreen/PWA contexts, no-ops in plain tabs) plus a CSS landscape-block overlay (`#rotate-block`) that covers phone-shaped viewports in landscape (`@media (orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 500px)`). Tablets/desktops in landscape stay interactive since the layout caps at 480px and centers.
- ✅ Layout unification — collapsed the game screen's two CSS layouts (info-strip ≤500px vs. side-panels >500px) into one phone-shaped layout that applies at every viewport. `.gr` capped at `max-width:480px`, `.left-panel`/`.right-panel` always `display:none`, `.info-strip` always shown. Removed the `@media(min-width:600px)` and `@media(min-width:900px)` width-scaling blocks for the game/home/setup/overlay containers. Real phones already rendered the info-strip layout (≤414 CSS-px in portrait); the desktop branch was dev-tool-only and looked unrelated to the actual product. See `docs-md/CHANGELOG.md` for the full file-level breakdown.
- ✅ Firebase emulator wired for browser playtesting — restored `?emu=1` flag in `firebaseClient.js` (calls `db.useEmulator` + `auth.useEmulator`), added auth/hosting/UI ports to `firebase.json`, added `npm run emu` script. Open `http://localhost:5000/?emu=1` in two browser profiles to play offline-vs-offline against the local DB without touching prod.
- ✅ Bug #2 real root cause — `presenceService` now restores `connected:true` on every WebSocket reconnect (`.info/connected` watcher) AND every heartbeat tick. Without this, a single transient WebSocket drop (auth-refresh blip, mobile network switch, etc.) caused the server's `onDisconnect` handler to write `connected:false`, after which the heartbeat kept updating only `lastSeen` — so `/presence/{uid}.connected` stayed false for the rest of the session and the opponent's `disconnectController` correctly read it as offline, firing the disconnect overlay. The earlier "strict continuous-offline semantics" fix in `disconnectController` is still correct as a separate guard against real flickers; together they cover both classes of bug #2.
- ✅ Phase 5 — fixed both prod bugs the user reported: (1) ghost-move-after-failed-commit in `onlineGameSession` (added `forceResync()` on every SYNC_REJECTED + try/catch around `commitTransaction` so permission_denied becomes `{committed:false}` instead of bubbling); (2) false-positive disconnect overlay in `disconnectController` (strict continuous-offline semantics — reset `totalDisconnectedMs` on every online transition that happens before the overlay opens). Headless full-stack E2E scenario reproduces both bugs deterministically and the fixes make all 5 sub-scenarios pass.
- ✅ Live connectivity indicator — wifi icon in the game top bar that goes red+blinking when the local Firebase WebSocket drops. New `connectivityService` subscribes to `.info/connected`; new `connectivityIndicator` controller toggles classes on `#net-status` in the game partial; only visible during online games.
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 4) — Adds `--scenario reconnect` covering reconnect-during-opponent-turn, reconnect-on-own-turn, and no-ghost-events-after-dispose. Verifies version-cursor anchoring, cache pre-warm on the new session, and watcher teardown via `dispose()`. 45 sub-scenario runs at scale: 0 crashes. No new engine bugs found this round — the session reconnect machinery holds up under stress.
- ✅ Watchdog forfeit production bug closed — relaxed `/rooms/$roomId` rule's opponent-watchdog branch to permit `turnDeadlineMs=0` when `status=abandoned`, so two consecutive missed turns can now actually transition the room to terminal. Two new emulator tests in `tests/emulator/timer-rules.test.mjs` cover both the positive case and the safety check (opponent cannot zero the deadline without flipping status). The simulator's `runForfeitAfterTwo` scenario is now re-enabled and passes.
- ✅ `handleConfirmMove` occupied-cell defense — rejects `CONFIRM_MOVE` whose placed tiles overlap an already-committed board cell. Without this check, `setCommittedTile` silently overwrote the existing tile (vanishing it), breaking bag-parity. Placed in `handleConfirmMove` (not `validateMove`) because the swap path correctly expects target cells to be occupied. Surfaced by the fuzz bot.
- ✅ `applyExchange` atomicity — pre-validates all letters against a rack copy before mutating, so a mixed-valid-and-bogus exchange (e.g. one letter not in rack) no longer leaves tiles partially removed. Same family as the Phase 3 `handleConfirmMove` fix but in the exchange path. Surfaced by fuzz sweep after the watchdog rule fix landed.
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 3) — Adds `--scenario watchdog` mode covering single-timeout, liveBonus gate, and double-claim race using injected clock (`timeoutWatchdog`'s `now`/`setIntervalFn` seams). Two more engine fixes shipped from simulator findings: `handleConfirmMove` now rejects placements whose letters aren't in the rack (closes the bag-parity gap surfaced by `--bot fuzz`); `timeoutWatchdog.applyPatchToRoom` defaults `activeBoosts` to `[]` instead of `undefined` (Firebase rejects undefined).
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 2) — Adds `--bot fuzz` adversarial bot and `--scenario matchmaking` concurrent-claim race scenario on top of Phase 1. CLI: `--bot random|fuzz`, `--fuzz-rate F`, `--scenario normal|matchmaking`, `--mm-players N`, `--mm-batches N`. The fuzz mode surfaced a real engine-defense gap (see Phase 3 TODO). See `docs-md/CHANGELOG.md` for the entry.
- ✅ passCount sync between online clients — fixed two real engine bugs caught by the simulator: (1) `onlineGameSession.commitCurrentState` now persists `_passCount` to the room and the watcher resync copies it back, so the global "4 consecutive scoreless turns" game-over rule actually works across clients; (2) `handleExchange` now calls `isGameOver()` after `passCount` bump, mirroring `handlePass` / `handleConfirmMove` (without this, four consecutive exchanges did not end the game).
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 1) — New `npm run sim` tool spins up the local Firebase emulator, runs N concurrent online games using random-move Hebrew bots, and writes structured crash reports for invariant violations, engine throws, transaction livelocks, or hangs. Lives under `scripts/simulator/`; no production code touched. See `docs-md/CHANGELOG.md` for the entry and `scripts/simulator/runSimulator.mjs --help` for flags.
- ✅ Gender address toggle Phase 2 — All Hebrew imperative strings (game controls, mini-game instructions, overlay buttons, friends/share text) now render in the correct gender form. Central utility `src/ui/genderText.js` with `g()`, `applyGenderToRoot()`. Live updates via `SETTINGS_CHANGED` bus event propagate to all mounted screens in one call.
- ✅ Gender address toggle Phase 1 — "באיזה לשון לפנות אליך?" (זכר/נקבה) added to settings screen. Stored in `uiPreferences` (localStorage only, never pushed to Firebase). The reminder push notification body (`"אתה לא משחק"` / `"את לא משחקת"`) now uses the correct gender form. Infrastructure in place (`VALUE_SELECTS` in `settingsScreen.js`).

---

## Completed (May 2026)

- ✅ Game summary UI fixes — ELO delta inconsistency fixed (both clients now read pre-game ratings from `globalRatings` for both players); "ללא הודעות" settings panel removed; rectangular gold resume button replaced with round circle button in the home screen secondary row; `נאצי` added to `EXACT_REJECTS`.


- ✅ Pre-launch polish — tutorial intro refreshed (drop ערעור, add bonus-square mention) + new scripted player step that lands 'י' on the row-5 right-edge bonus to demo bonus activation; `#lcd "מהלכים"` move counter removed from game.html + gameScreen.js; privacy policy rewritten for auth/push/friends/ratings/in-game messages; new "ללא הודעות" setting (local-only, gated in reactionController to hide button + ignore incoming bubbles); end-game screen now shows Elo new-rating + signed delta per player via `RATING_EVT.CHANGED`.

- ✅ Scoreless-turn game-over rule unified — threshold 6→4, exchanges and illegal-word forfeits now count toward `passCount`, and a leading player can fire `CMD.CLAIM_STALL_END` (new "🏆 סיים וזכה" topbar button) once `passCount >= 2` to close out a stalled lost-game-drag-out scenario. Pre-launch change, no migration.

- ✅ In-app help dropdown with Tutorial / Guide / FAQ — top-bar `?` now opens an anchored dropdown; "מדריך" opens a 6-section accordion guide (rules, inflections, screens, modes, ratings, bonuses); "שאלות נפוצות" opens a ~12-item Q&A overlay. Existing tutorial flow preserved (dropdown re-emits `OPEN_TUTORIAL`).

- ✅ Online end-game suite — ELO `permission_denied` fixed by per-client write model (each side writes only its own profile + leaderboard entry; opponent's rating read from publicly-readable `globalRatings`); ELO now skipped for 0-move games; `currentUserProfile` undefined-global ReferenceError fixed in avatar-unlock overlay; matchmaking/friend-invite avatar field corrected (`profile.avatar` → `profile.equippedAvatar`) so opponents render with their actual emoji instead of the 👑 default.

- ✅ Matchmaking pair-claim race fix — `tryPair` now claims the queue pair via a single RTDB transaction on `/matchmakingQueue/{mode}` instead of multi-path update + verify. Eliminates the bug where two simultaneous matchmakers each created their own room and the coin-toss showed each player as the starting one.

- ✅ In-game reaction system — child-safe emoji + Hebrew preset message reactions for online games. Reaction panel opens from player card, sends to Firebase `liveReaction` field, shows animated speech bubbles. 5-second cooldown, local mute toggle. No free-text, no gameplay impact.

- ✅ Offline save/resume for 2P + vs-Bot — `pause → שמור וצא לתפריט` and back-button `השהה ושמור` now persist the full engine state to localStorage via `localSaveService`; home `המשך משחק` falls back to the local save when no online async session exists. Cleared on game completion.
- ✅ Notifications bell inbox — bell badge shows live count of pending game invites + friend requests; clicking opens `#snotif` inbox with accept/reject per item.
- ✅ Waiting room async/live invite behavior — async direct invite closes waiting overlay after 1.5 s; live direct invite shows 5-min countdown, cancels pending room + invite on Firebase on expiry.
- ✅ Notification banner + invite UX — blocking invite popups replaced with slide-down banner from topbar; banner suppressed on app open; cancel in waiting room cancels live invite too.
- ✅ Reject-name fix — banner now shows real player display name (not "שחקן") when rejecting an invite.
- ✅ Speed presets — "זמן מוגבל למהלך" removed from settings; 3 presets (בזק/רגיל/איטי) added to setup, create-room, and matchmaking screens.
- ✅ Favorite move-speed statistic — moveSpeedStats tracked per game; displayed in Records tab.

- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms main menu redesign — `menu-electric.css` + updated `home.html`, `menuScreen.js`, `main.js`
- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms Phase 2 visual polish — premium platform architecture, double-path SVG lightning, atmospheric background, animations
- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms Stage 3 depth pass — floating illusion via offset shadow, curved organic lightning, particle field, compressed layout, blue ELO badge, enlarged online icon
- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms Stage 4 gap-report pass — viewport-fit=cover, near-black background, 3D slab bottom face, icon depth with specular highlight, logo glow, nav 28px icons + active pill, lightning pulse + particle drift animations
- ✅ Stats screen simplification — cut ~10 low-value stats, collapsed 5 tabs to 3 (תקדמות / שיאים / יריבים ובוסטים). UI-only; storage unchanged.

## Stats screen — follow-up opportunities

Surfaced during the May 2026 stats simplification audit. Each is a UI-visible add that requires backing data work.

- [ ] **Bingo count** — biggest gap. Tally `BINGO_BONUS` triggers per game and surface in Records tab.
- [ ] **Highest single-word score** — derive from move history, store on profile, surface in Records.
- [x] **Unique words discovered (vocabulary size / מילון מהלך)** — `uniqueWordsCount` is now tracked in `computeLiveGameStatsDelta` as a numeric increment of new words per game (June 2026).
- [ ] **Win rate by first/second to move** — already trackable from move metadata.
- [ ] **Hour-of-day stats / power hour** — extend the existing `weekdayStats` model.
- [~] **Earned titles** ("Comeback King", "Bingo Hunter", etc.) — named achievements with Hebrew titles now exist in `ACHIEVEMENTS` table (`avatarScreens.js`). The stat-based conditions are wired; purely narrative titles (Comeback King etc.) require additional stats (comeback tracking, bingo count) not yet collected. See TASKS.md bingo-count and highest-single-word items above.
- [x] **חבר של כולם (friendsCount)** — synced from Firebase friends list via `activeFriendsWatch` (June 2026).
- [x] **האחד (beatNumberOne)** — tracked at game end when result=win, opponent was pre-game #1, and ≥1000 total players (June 2026).
- [ ] **Move timing** — `totalMoveTimeMs` is hardcoded to 0 in `profileService.js:251`. Either wire it up (per-move timestamps in the event stream) or remove the field entirely.
- [ ] **Storage cleanup** — once the new layout settles, remove orphan fields (`boostImpactWins`, `totalMoveTimeMs`, etc.) from `EMPTY_STATS` and add a one-time cleanup migration.

## Active Cutover Checklist (from `SPINE_TODO.md`)

The `SPINE_TODO.md` file is the authoritative tracking document for the legacy→spine migration. Key outstanding areas as of documentation date:

### High Priority (Cutover Blockers)

- [ ] Verify all B1–B13 bonus mini-game branches work end-to-end in live game
- [ ] Verify deferred scoring (two-phase commit) works correctly in online mode under latency
- [ ] Verify multiplier forfeiture on timeout/resign (boost effect cleanup)
- [ ] Disconnect/leave flow Phase 1B+ (Phase 1A complete per recent commits)
- [ ] UI state reset/preservation between game start and end (screen cleanup)
- [ ] Tutorial flow full verification with scripted bot
- [ ] Dictionary admin flow (approval/rejection UI + validation)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Profile/stats/avatar progression parity with legacy
- [ ] Champion leaderboard display correctness (`RATINGS_LIMIT = 10`)
- [ ] `settingsCompat.js` migration from very old localStorage formats
- [ ] Music/sound scheduling behavior characterization
- [ ] Mobile layout verification on small screens (320px width)
- [ ] Menu transition animation parity
- [ ] Appeal/dictionary challenge flow (`appealsMax` setting)

### Low Priority (Cleanup)

- [ ] Remove legacy `onclick` attributes from all remaining partials
- [ ] Remove legacy global functions from `index.html` once spine covers all paths
- [ ] Add `src/testing/` tests to main test runner (currently separate)
- [ ] Document `botSearch.js` algorithm

---

## Security Tasks

### Critical
- [ ] **Move OneSignal REST key server-side** — The `onesignalKey` is currently used from the browser. Move push sending to a Cloud Function or edge worker to prevent key exposure.

### Medium
- [ ] Verify admin custom claim flow end-to-end (claim set → token refresh → admin UI unlocks)
- [ ] Audit who can trigger `asyncReminderService.sweepForUser()` — currently any authenticated client can call it for any `uid`

---

## Missing Tests to Write

Based on GAP_REPORT.md findings:

1. **`botSearch.js` unit tests** — Verify bot produces valid Hebrew words, legal placements
2. **B8 crossword mini-game** — End-to-end test with mock mini-game completion
3. **B11 word search** — Result resolution and score commit
4. **B13 wheel all outcomes** — One test per wheel outcome (8 outcomes)
5. **Multiplier forfeiture** — Test that `multiply_next_turns` is removed on timeout
6. **`asyncReminderService.sweepForUser()`** — Full sweep execution test (not just `classify()`)
7. **Double-sweep idempotency** — Two sweeps in the same window should not double-notify
8. **`settingsCompat.js` migration** — From V0 → V1 → spine format
9. **Dictionary approved words → validation** — Prove approved Firebase words are used in `isValid()`
10. **Watchdog transaction failure** — Simulate `committed: false` and verify retry/fallback
11. **`EXACT_REJECTS` completeness** — Verify all ~220 entries are genuinely invalid words
12. **Friend request lifecycle** — `friendsService.js` send → accept → appear in friends list

---

## Architecture Recommendations

### Near-Term

1. **Consolidate timing constants** — `animationController.js` and `gameScreen.js` both define identical timing constants. Extract to a shared `animationConstants.js` file.

2. **Add Cloud Function for push** — Move `onesignalKey` usage to a server-side function. OneSignal supports Cloud Functions as a backend.

3. **Add explicit watchdog retry** — `timeoutWatchdog.js` should log and handle `committed: false` returns explicitly, even if it just means "do nothing and wait for next poll."

4. **`isValid()` cache warm-up** — `hebrewDictionary.loadDict()` is async. Any call to `isValid()` before the dict is ready falls back to `analyze()`. Consider a "dict ready" event on the bus so UI can gate validation properly.

### Long-Term

1. **Cloud Function for reminders** — Move `asyncReminderService` to a Cloud Function triggered on Firebase write. This ensures reminders fire even when no player has the app open.

2. **Bundler / Code Splitting** — As the codebase grows past 50 modules, consider a minimal bundler pass for production to reduce HTTP round trips for module loading.

3. **Visual Regression Tests** — Add Playwright screenshot comparison tests for the game board to catch CSS regressions.
