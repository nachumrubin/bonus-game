## TODOs — Online Simulator (Phase 5)

- [ ] Deferred-score split-write scenario: dispose the active session AFTER `MOVE_CONFIRMED(scoringDeferred=true)` but BEFORE `FINALIZE_BOOST_AWARD`. Verify the room state stays consistent (no half-committed move), the opponent's view isn't corrupted, and the reconnected session correctly sees the move as never-committed. Needs bonus-square placement to be driven deterministically (bonuses sit at off-grid edges; random bot rarely hits them) — either inject a scripted-move bot or seed the engine state with `state.pendingScoreCommit` directly.
- [ ] Admin-SDK exporter that pulls `moveHistory` arrays from prod rooms into the JSON shape `replayBot` expects, for `--replay` mode (needs prod creds).
- [ ] Presence/heartbeat stress: multiple concurrent `presenceService` writes from the same uid (multi-tab), verify `onDisconnect` cleanup doesn't fight presence heartbeat.

---

## Completed (June 2026)

- ✅ Portrait-orientation enforcement — installed PWA already locked via `manifest.json`. For in-browser use, added `screen.orientation.lock('portrait')` in [src/main.js](../src/main.js) (works in fullscreen/PWA contexts, no-ops in plain tabs) plus a CSS landscape-block overlay (`#rotate-block`) that covers phone-shaped viewports in landscape (`@media (orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 500px)`). Tablets/desktops in landscape stay interactive since the layout caps at 480px and centers.
- ✅ Layout unification — collapsed the game screen's two CSS layouts (info-strip ≤500px vs. side-panels >500px) into one phone-shaped layout that applies at every viewport. `.gr` capped at `max-width:480px`, `.left-panel`/`.right-panel` always `display:none`, `.info-strip` always shown. Removed the `@media(min-width:600px)` and `@media(min-width:900px)` width-scaling blocks for the game/home/setup/overlay containers. Real phones already rendered the info-strip layout (≤414 CSS-px in portrait); the desktop branch was dev-tool-only and looked unrelated to the actual product. See `docs-md/CHANGELOG.md` for the full file-level breakdown.
- ✅ Firebase emulator wired for browser playtesting — restored `?emu=1` flag in `firebaseClient.js` (calls `db.useEmulator` + `auth.useEmulator`), added auth/hosting/UI ports to `firebase.json`, added `npm run emu` script. Open `http://localhost:5000/?emu=1` in two browser profiles to play offline-vs-offline against the local DB without touching prod.
- ✅ Bug #2 real root cause — `presenceService` now restores `connected:true` on every WebSocket reconnect (`.info/connected` watcher) AND every heartbeat tick. Without this, a single transient WebSocket drop (auth-refresh blip, mobile network switch, etc.) caused the server's `onDisconnect` handler to write `connected:false`, after which the heartbeat kept updating only `lastSeen` — so `/presence/{uid}.connected` stayed false for the rest of the session and the opponent's `disconnectController` correctly read it as offline, firing the disconnect overlay. The earlier "strict continuous-offline semantics" fix in `disconnectController` is still correct as a separate guard against real flickers; together they cover both classes of bug #2.
- ✅ Phase 5 — fixed both prod bugs the user reported: (1) ghost-move-after-failed-commit in `onlineGameSession` (added `forceResync()` on every SYNC_REJECTED + try/catch around `commitTransaction` so permission_denied becomes `{committed:false}` instead of bubbling); (2) false-positive disconnect overlay in `disconnectController` (strict continuous-offline semantics — reset `totalDisconnectedMs` on every online transition that happens before the overlay opens). Headless full-stack E2E scenario reproduces both bugs deterministically and the fixes make all 5 sub-scenarios pass.
- ✅ Live connectivity indicator — wifi icon in the game top bar that goes red+blinking when the local Firebase WebSocket drops. New `connectivityService` subscribes to `.info/connected`; new `connectivityIndicator` controller toggles classes on `#net-status` in the game partial; only visible during online games.
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 4) — Adds `--scenario reconnect` covering reconnect-during-opponent-turn, reconnect-on-own-turn, and no-ghost-events-after-dispose. Verifies version-cursor anchoring, cache pre-warm on the new session, and watcher teardown via `dispose()`. 45 sub-scenario runs at scale: 0 crashes. No new engine bugs found this round — the session reconnect machinery holds up under stress.
- ✅ Watchdog forfeit production bug closed — relaxed `/rooms/$roomId` rule's opponent-watchdog branch to permit `turnDeadlineMs=0` when `status=abandoned`, so two consecutive missed turns can now actually transition the room to terminal. Two new emulator tests in `tests/emulator/timer-rules.test.mjs` cover both the positive case and the safety check (opponent cannot zero the deadline without flipping status). The simulator's `runForfeitAfterTwo` scenario is now re-enabled and passes.
- ✅ `handleConfirmMove` occupied-cell defense — rejects `CONFIRM_MOVE` whose placed tiles overlap an already-committed board cell. Without this check, `setCommittedTile` silently overwrote the existing tile (vanishing it), breaking bag-parity. Placed in `handleConfirmMove` (not `validateMove`) because the swap path correctly expects target cells to be occupied. Surfaced by the fuzz bot.
- ✅ `applyExchange` atomicity — pre-validates all letters against a rack copy before mutating, so a mixed-valid-and-bogus exchange (e.g. one letter not in rack) no longer leaves tiles partially removed. Same family as the Phase 3 `handleConfirmMove` fix but in the exchange path. Surfaced by fuzz sweep after the watchdog rule fix landed.
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 3) — Adds `--scenario watchdog` mode covering single-timeout, liveBonus gate, and double-claim race using injected clock (`timeoutWatchdog`'s `now`/`setIntervalFn` seams). Two more engine fixes shipped from simulator findings: `handleConfirmMove` now rejects placements whose letters aren't in the rack (closes the bag-parity gap surfaced by `--bot fuzz`); `timeoutWatchdog.applyPatchToRoom` defaults `activeBoosts` to `[]` instead of `undefined` (Firebase rejects undefined).
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 2) — Adds `--bot fuzz` adversarial bot and `--scenario matchmaking` concurrent-claim race scenario on top of Phase 1. CLI: `--bot random|fuzz`, `--fuzz-rate F`, `--scenario normal|matchmaking`, `--mm-players N`, `--mm-batches N`. The fuzz mode surfaced a real engine-defense gap (see Phase 3 TODO). See `docs-md/CHANGELOG.md` for the entry.
- ✅ passCount sync between online clients — fixed two real engine bugs caught by the simulator: (1) `onlineGameSession.commitCurrentState` now persists `_passCount` to the room and the watcher resync copies it back, so the global "4 consecutive scoreless turns" game-over rule actually works across clients; (2) `handleExchange` now calls `isGameOver()` after `passCount` bump, mirroring `handlePass` / `handleConfirmMove` (without this, four consecutive exchanges did not end the game).
- ✅ Online game simulator (Phase 1) — New `npm run sim` tool spins up the local Firebase emulator, runs N concurrent online games using random-move Hebrew bots, and writes structured crash reports for invariant violations, engine throws, transaction livelocks, or hangs. Lives under `scripts/simulator/`; no production code touched. See `docs-md/CHANGELOG.md` for the entry and `scripts/simulator/runSimulator.mjs --help` for flags.
- ✅ Gender address toggle Phase 2 — All Hebrew imperative strings (game controls, mini-game instructions, overlay buttons, friends/share text) now render in the correct gender form. Central utility `src/ui/genderText.js` with `g()`, `applyGenderToRoot()`. Live updates via `SETTINGS_CHANGED` bus event propagate to all mounted screens in one call.
- ✅ Gender address toggle Phase 1 — "באיזה לשון לפנות אליך?" (זכר/נקבה) added to settings screen. Stored in `uiPreferences` (localStorage only, never pushed to Firebase). The reminder push notification body (`"אתה לא משחק"` / `"את לא משחקת"`) now uses the correct gender form. Infrastructure in place (`VALUE_SELECTS` in `settingsScreen.js`).

---

## Completed (May 2026)

- ✅ Game summary UI fixes — ELO delta inconsistency fixed (both clients now read pre-game ratings from `globalRatings` for both players); "ללא הודעות" settings panel removed; rectangular gold resume button replaced with round circle button in the home screen secondary row; `נאצי` added to `EXACT_REJECTS`.


- ✅ Pre-launch polish — tutorial intro refreshed (drop ערעור, add bonus-square mention) + new scripted player step that lands 'י' on the row-5 right-edge bonus to demo bonus activation; `#lcd "מהלכים"` move counter removed from game.html + gameScreen.js; privacy policy rewritten for auth/push/friends/ratings/in-game messages; new "ללא הודעות" setting (local-only, gated in reactionController to hide button + ignore incoming bubbles); end-game screen now shows Elo new-rating + signed delta per player via `RATING_EVT.CHANGED`.

- ✅ Scoreless-turn game-over rule unified — threshold 6→4, exchanges and illegal-word forfeits now count toward `passCount`, and a leading player can fire `CMD.CLAIM_STALL_END` (new "🏆 סיים וזכה" topbar button) once `passCount >= 2` to close out a stalled lost-game-drag-out scenario. Pre-launch change, no migration.

- ✅ In-app help dropdown with Tutorial / Guide / FAQ — top-bar `?` now opens an anchored dropdown; "מדריך" opens a 6-section accordion guide (rules, inflections, screens, modes, ratings, bonuses); "שאלות נפוצות" opens a ~12-item Q&A overlay. Existing tutorial flow preserved (dropdown re-emits `OPEN_TUTORIAL`).

- ✅ Online end-game suite — ELO `permission_denied` fixed by per-client write model (each side writes only its own profile + leaderboard entry; opponent's rating read from publicly-readable `globalRatings`); ELO now skipped for 0-move games; `currentUserProfile` undefined-global ReferenceError fixed in avatar-unlock overlay; matchmaking/friend-invite avatar field corrected (`profile.avatar` → `profile.equippedAvatar`) so opponents render with their actual emoji instead of the 👑 default.

- ✅ Matchmaking pair-claim race fix — `tryPair` now claims the queue pair via a single RTDB transaction on `/matchmakingQueue/{mode}` instead of multi-path update + verify. Eliminates the bug where two simultaneous matchmakers each created their own room and the coin-toss showed each player as the starting one.

- ✅ In-game reaction system — child-safe emoji + Hebrew preset message reactions for online games. Reaction panel opens from player card, sends to Firebase `liveReaction` field, shows animated speech bubbles. 5-second cooldown, local mute toggle. No free-text, no gameplay impact.

- ✅ Offline save/resume for 2P + vs-Bot — `pause → שמור וצא לתפריט` and back-button `השהה ושמור` now persist the full engine state to localStorage via `localSaveService`; home `המשך משחק` falls back to the local save when no online async session exists. Cleared on game completion.
- ✅ Notifications bell inbox — bell badge shows live count of pending game invites + friend requests; clicking opens `#snotif` inbox with accept/reject per item.
- ✅ Waiting room async/live invite behavior — async direct invite closes waiting overlay after 1.5 s; live direct invite shows 5-min countdown, cancels pending room + invite on Firebase on expiry.
- ✅ Notification banner + invite UX — blocking invite popups replaced with slide-down banner from topbar; banner suppressed on app open; cancel in waiting room cancels live invite too.
- ✅ Reject-name fix — banner now shows real player display name (not "שחקן") when rejecting an invite.
- ✅ Speed presets — "זמן מוגבל למהלך" removed from settings; 3 presets (בזק/רגיל/איטי) added to setup, create-room, and matchmaking screens.
- ✅ Favorite move-speed statistic — moveSpeedStats tracked per game; displayed in Records tab.

- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms main menu redesign — `menu-electric.css` + updated `home.html`, `menuScreen.js`, `main.js`
- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms Phase 2 visual polish — premium platform architecture, double-path SVG lightning, atmospheric background, animations
- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms Stage 3 depth pass — floating illusion via offset shadow, curved organic lightning, particle field, compressed layout, blue ELO badge, enlarged online icon
- ✅ Electric Floating Platforms Stage 4 gap-report pass — viewport-fit=cover, near-black background, 3D slab bottom face, icon depth with specular highlight, logo glow, nav 28px icons + active pill, lightning pulse + particle drift animations
- ✅ Stats screen simplification — cut ~10 low-value stats, collapsed 5 tabs to 3 (תקדמות / שיאים / יריבים ובוסטים). UI-only; storage unchanged.

## Stats screen — follow-up opportunities

Surfaced during the May 2026 stats simplification audit. Each is a UI-visible add that requires backing data work.

- [ ] **Bingo count** — biggest gap. Tally `BINGO_BONUS` triggers per game and surface in Records tab.
- [ ] **Highest single-word score** — derive from move history, store on profile, surface in Records.
- [ ] **Unique words discovered (vocabulary size)** — count of `wordCounts{}` keys; surface in Records.
- [ ] **Win rate by first/second to move** — already trackable from move metadata.
- [ ] **Hour-of-day stats / power hour** — extend the existing `weekdayStats` model.
- [~] **Earned titles** ("Comeback King", "Bingo Hunter", etc.) — named achievements with Hebrew titles now exist in `ACHIEVEMENTS` table (`avatarScreens.js`). The stat-based conditions are wired; purely narrative titles (Comeback King etc.) require additional stats (comeback tracking, bingo count) not yet collected. See TASKS.md bingo-count and highest-single-word items above.
- [ ] **Move timing** — `totalMoveTimeMs` is hardcoded to 0 in `profileService.js:251`. Either wire it up (per-move timestamps in the event stream) or remove the field entirely.
- [ ] **Storage cleanup** — once the new layout settles, remove orphan fields (`boostImpactWins`, `totalMoveTimeMs`, etc.) from `EMPTY_STATS` and add a one-time cleanup migration.

## Active Cutover Checklist (from `SPINE_TODO.md`)

The `SPINE_TODO.md` file is the authoritative tracking document for the legacy→spine migration. Key outstanding areas as of documentation date:

### High Priority (Cutover Blockers)

- [ ] Verify all B1–B13 bonus mini-game branches work end-to-end in live game
- [ ] Verify deferred scoring (two-phase commit) works correctly in online mode under latency
- [ ] Verify multiplier forfeiture on timeout/resign (boost effect cleanup)
- [ ] Disconnect/leave flow Phase 1B+ (Phase 1A complete per recent commits)
- [ ] UI state reset/preservation between game start and end (screen cleanup)
- [ ] Tutorial flow full verification with scripted bot
- [ ] Dictionary admin flow (approval/rejection UI + validation)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Profile/stats/avatar progression parity with legacy
- [ ] Champion leaderboard display correctness (`RATINGS_LIMIT = 10`)
- [ ] `settingsCompat.js` migration from very old localStorage formats
- [ ] Music/sound scheduling behavior characterization
- [ ] Mobile layout verification on small screens (320px width)
- [ ] Menu transition animation parity
- [ ] Appeal/dictionary challenge flow (`appealsMax` setting)

### Low Priority (Cleanup)

- [ ] Remove legacy `onclick` attributes from all remaining partials
- [ ] Remove legacy global functions from `index.html` once spine covers all paths
- [ ] Add `src/testing/` tests to main test runner (currently separate)
- [ ] Document `botSearch.js` algorithm

---

## Security Tasks

### Critical
- [ ] **Move OneSignal REST key server-side** — The `onesignalKey` is currently used from the browser. Move push sending to a Cloud Function or edge worker to prevent key exposure.

### Medium
- [ ] Verify admin custom claim flow end-to-end (claim set → token refresh → admin UI unlocks)
- [ ] Audit who can trigger `asyncReminderService.sweepForUser()` — currently any authenticated client can call it for any `uid`

---

## Missing Tests to Write

Based on GAP_REPORT.md findings:

1. **`botSearch.js` unit tests** — Verify bot produces valid Hebrew words, legal placements
2. **B8 crossword mini-game** — End-to-end test with mock mini-game completion
3. **B11 word search** — Result resolution and score commit
4. **B13 wheel all outcomes** — One test per wheel outcome (8 outcomes)
5. **Multiplier forfeiture** — Test that `multiply_next_turns` is removed on timeout
6. **`asyncReminderService.sweepForUser()`** — Full sweep execution test (not just `classify()`)
7. **Double-sweep idempotency** — Two sweeps in the same window should not double-notify
8. **`settingsCompat.js` migration** — From V0 → V1 → spine format
9. **Dictionary approved words → validation** — Prove approved Firebase words are used in `isValid()`
10. **Watchdog transaction failure** — Simulate `committed: false` and verify retry/fallback
11. **`EXACT_REJECTS` completeness** — Verify all ~220 entries are genuinely invalid words
12. **Friend request lifecycle** — `friendsService.js` send → accept → appear in friends list

---

## Architecture Recommendations

### Near-Term

1. **Consolidate timing constants** — `animationController.js` and `gameScreen.js` both define identical timing constants. Extract to a shared `animationConstants.js` file.

2. **Add Cloud Function for push** — Move `onesignalKey` usage to a server-side function. OneSignal supports Cloud Functions as a backend.

3. **Add explicit watchdog retry** — `timeoutWatchdog.js` should log and handle `committed: false` returns explicitly, even if it just means "do nothing and wait for next poll."

4. **`isValid()` cache warm-up** — `hebrewDictionary.loadDict()` is async. Any call to `isValid()` before the dict is ready falls back to `analyze()`. Consider a "dict ready" event on the bus so UI can gate validation properly.

### Long-Term

1. **Cloud Function for reminders** — Move `asyncReminderService` to a Cloud Function triggered on Firebase write. This ensures reminders fire even when no player has the app open.

2. **Bundler / Code Splitting** — As the codebase grows past 50 modules, consider a minimal bundler pass for production to reduce HTTP round trips for module loading.

3. **Visual Regression Tests** — Add Playwright screenshot comparison tests for the game board to catch CSS regressions.
